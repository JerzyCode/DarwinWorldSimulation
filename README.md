# DarwinWorldSimulation üåçü¶†

## üìå Project Description
**DarwinWorldSimulation** is a Java-based simulation inspired by Darwin‚Äôs theory of evolution. Organisms navigate the map, consume resources, reproduce, and mutate, leading to an emergent evolutionary process. The project is implemented using **JavaFX** for graphical visualization.

### ‚ú® Features
- **Animals and resources are randomly generated on the map** when the simulation starts."
- **Organisms with DNA-based behavior**, affecting movement and survival.
- **Mutation and evolution system**, simulating natural selection.
- **Multiple simulation configurations**, allowing for custom scenarios.
- **Fire events**, spreading through vegetation and affecting organisms.
- **Plant growth mechanics**, favoring specific zones (e.g., equator-like regions).
- **Advanced statistics tracking**, including population, energy levels, and lifespan.
- **JavaFX-based interactive UI**, supporting multiple simultaneous simulations.
- **Pause and resume functionality**, enabling detailed analysis.
- **CSV data export**, allowing for further research and analysis.

## üõ† How to Install and Run the Project
### Prerequisites
- **JDK 21**
- **JavaFX**
- **Gradle**

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JerzyCode/DarwinWorldSimulation.git
   cd ooplab
   ```
2. Download and install the **JavaFX SDK** if not already installed:
    - [JavaFX SDK](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/)
3. Build and run using Gradle:

   build:    ```./gradlew build```

   run: ```./gradlew run```

## üéÆ How to Use the Project
1. **Start a new simulation** by selecting a predefined configuration or creating a custom one.
2. **Configure parameters** such as map size, starting number of organisms, mutation rules, and plant growth settings.
3. **Launch the simulation**, which opens a new interactive window.
4. Observe the organisms **move, eat, reproduce, and evolve** over time.
5. **Pause or resume the simulation** at any moment.
6. Track **detailed statistics**, including energy levels, genotype distribution, and organism lifespan.
7. Optionally, **export data to CSV** for external analysis.
